Project Title: Fetal Health Classification based on Cardiotocogram (CTG) Data - Comparison of Classification Model Performance

Description and Objectives: The objective of our project will be to compare classification models to classify the outcome of Cardiotocogram (CTG) exam in order to reduce child mortality rates.

Background: 

The reduction in child and maternal mortality rates serve as key indicators of societal progress. In 2019, the United Nations International Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF) reported a mortality rate of 38/1000 for under-five deaths, which is when a child passes away between birth and exactly five years of age. 

This rate translates to approximately 5.2 million under-five-deaths worldwide from countries reporting their data. In tandem to under-five-deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 295,000 women have died during and after pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. 

With the use cardiotocograms (CTGs), which are cost efficient fetal heart monitors, healthcare professionals are able to take preventative action and reduce the chances of child and maternal mortality. For this study, we aim to use cardiotocogram data to classify CTG features into three health rates, with the motivation to improve child and parent survival rates.
